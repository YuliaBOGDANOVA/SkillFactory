## Project-2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


# Problem statement

General goal is to track the impact of the living conditions of students aged from 15 to 22 on their math performance in order to identify students at an early stage at risk.
An approximation model must be built to predict exam mark for each student. To get a training sample it's necessary to select important features from given dataset stud_math.csv.



# Answers to self-reflection questions

1. What was your role in the team?
Mmm... Strange question, because there is no any team)

2. What part of your job were you most satisfied with?
All. Hope, the work is done very well :)

3. What didn't work out the way you wanted? What else is worth working on?
Nothing. Really nothing.

4. What interesting and useful things did you learn in this module?
A lot of! EDA is the most important part of data analysis, I think.

5. What is the main result of this project?
Skill to separate crucial features for further approximation model building.

6. What skills can you already apply in your current work?
Correlation analysis and math stat.

7. Do you plan to study additional materials on the project topic?
Yep. More about dependency analysis.
